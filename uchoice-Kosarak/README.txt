In this universal choice dataset, subset choices are a de-duplicated set of
links on a Hungarian news portal visited by a user in a given browsing session.
This dataset was derived from the data at
http://fimi.ua.ac.be/data/

Each line of the two data files
1. uchoice-Kosarak.txt
2. uchoice-Kosarak-5-25.txt
is a space-separated list of integers, corresponding to a single subset
selection. The second file is a restriction of the subset selections in the
first file so that each selection contains at most 5 items and all items appear
in at least 25 selections. In our paper, we used the restricted (second) dataset
in our experiments.
